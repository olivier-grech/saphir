# Saphir

This is the repository of my IRC dice bot, **Saphir**.

## How to use Saphir

Download Saphir on the [release](https://github.com/olivier-grech/saphir/releases) page. Once downloaded, modify the `config.json` file according to your IRC server and channel before launching Saphir.

Once the bot has joined your IRC channel, type `!help` to see a list of available commands.
