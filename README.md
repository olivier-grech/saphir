# Saphir

This is the repository of my IRC dice bot, **Saphir**.

## How to use Saphir

Download Saphir on the 
[release](https://github.com/olivier-grech/saphir/releases) page. Once 
downloaded, modify the `config.json` file according to your IRC server and 
channel before launching Saphir.

Once the bot has joined your IRC channel, type `!help` to see a list of
available commands.
